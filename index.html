			<h1>Hello, i'm Marie :)</h1>

				<p>I am a second year student at the IESEG School of Management 📚 and I have been passionate about horse riding for 12 years 🏇🏻. I love sports, travelling and enjoying my family and friends. I also like theater. Outgoing, curious and caring by nature, I enjoy helping others and continually learning new things 😎. </p>

			<h2> Sport 🥇</h2>

			<h2> Travelling ✈️📍</h2>
				<p> I love travelling with my family and my friends. Discovering the whole world is one of my life goals. Going to the sun 🌞, to the mountains 🏞, to the city or to the desert, we always leave with a lot of memories. To keep a trace of these wonderful moments I make video montages. </p>
